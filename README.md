##### The alternative to a physical photo booth - select one of the stock photos, or upload your own.  Choose from over 30 different props to use.  When done, just click on the "Save Button".

##### This project was built using React/Redux with Webpack to improve page performance, given inevitably large page size due to higher quality stock photos.
