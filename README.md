# Features

The alternative to a physical photo booth - select one of the stock photos, or upload your own.  Choose from over 30 different props to use.  Click on the prop, then drag/rotate/resize it.  When done, just click on the "Save" Button.

VPB was built using React/Redux with Webpack to improve page performance, notably for decreasing load time. [KonvaJS](https://konvajs.org/) provides easy-to-integrate canvas manipulation, and is arguably the main library for this project.

VPB currently includes the following features...

* Stock Photo Selection, or Upload Personal Photo to Canvas
* Prop Selection onto Canvas; Support prop drag, resize, and rotation
* "Clear Button" on NavBar removes props from Canvas
* "Save Button" downloads final photo onto machine


# How to Use

This project uses NPM (Node Package Manager) to handle dependencies.  As such, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) onto your machine.

From your command line:

# Future Updates

VPB still lacks several many features, that other popular photo editing apps have.  The following updates are planned...

* Instagram-like Filters

* Other Canvas Tools for users, like free hand drawing and text
* Real-Time Webcam Integration
